<!-- # PETRARCH GigaWord sample file

# statutes sample of sentences from the LDC Gigaword corpus file AFP0808-02.txt that 
# demonstrate some of the basic coding capabilities of PETRARCH. While these are actual 
# sentences, this sample is intended as a "proof-of-concept" only and are not 
# representative of the overall performance of the system, which is still in development 
# mode and many pattern-matching features are not fully implemented.
